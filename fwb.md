<h1>Flo the Wobble Bobble</h1>

Flo the Wobble Bobble started as a fun way to channel my emotions - no matter what strong feelings I experience, I would quickly sketch a suitable wobble bobble, and even when I feel angry or sad, Flo never fails to cheer me up! Now Flo has gone digital: I've made a basic Flo the Wobble Bobble sticker pack for WhatsApp for everyone (with an Android device) to enjoy. More Flo the Wobble Bobble stuff coming up soon.
