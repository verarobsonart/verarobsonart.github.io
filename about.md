<h3>About me</h3>

<p>I live in Sydney and like to draw and paint.</p>

<p>I've taken some art classes in the recent years, with <a href = "https://kevinmckayart.com/">Kevin McKay</a> and <a href="https://thefoldsouthernhighlands.com.au/the-guide/a-good-read-artist-noel-thurgate.html">Noel Thurgate</a> (at Waverley Woollahra Art School and at the National Art School in Sydney), and in 2022 I received a student grant from the William Fletcher Foundation.</p>

<h3>How to engage</h3>

<p>My drawings and paintings can be viewed on my website and some select works are on display and available for purchase at <a href="https://www.sthsthkingst.com/">SthSthKingSt Gallery</a> in Sydney. There's also prints available on <a href="https://www.redbubble.com/people/verarobsonart/shop">Red Bubble</a>.
