<h3>About me</h3>

<p>I live in Sydney and like to draw and paint.</p>

<p>I've taken some art classes in the recent years, with <a href = "https://kevinmckayart.com/">Kevin McKay</a> and <a href="https://thefoldsouthernhighlands.com.au/the-guide/a-good-read-artist-noel-thurgate.html">Noel Thurgate</a> (at Waverley Woollahra Art School and at the National Art School in Sydney), and in 2022 I received a student grant from the William Fletcher Foundation. Currently I am learning drawing basics on Proko, that is why there aren't many new works appearing on the site.</p>
