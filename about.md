<h3> Artist's Statement</h3>

<p>I am not an artist, but I like art and I like to draw and paint.</p>

<p>I've taken some art classes in the recent years, with Kevin McKay and Noel Thurgate (at Waverley Woollahra Art School and at the National Art School in Sydney), and in 2022 I received a student grant from the William Fletcher Foundation.</p>


<h3>How to engage</h3>

<p>My art can be viewed on my website and some select works are on display and available for purchase at <a href="https://www.sthsthkingst.com/">SthSthKingSt Gallery</a> in Sydney. I am also available for commissions, artistic collaborations, and any other inquiries at <a href = "mailto:verarobsonart@gmail.com">verarobsonart@gmail.com</a>.</p>
